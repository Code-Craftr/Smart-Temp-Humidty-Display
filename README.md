<p>In this project I have created a smart Humidity and temperature sensor in, what is does is it uses a DHT22 sensor to tell temperature and humidity of your room what extra it does it also has a ir blaster and you can use it to control your things like tv, soundbar or fan if it supports ir communication..
<br/>

How it works is first I have decode the Ir signal from the original remote of the fan(which I used), than I created a my first circuit connect the seven segement display and dht 22 the display shows temp and humidity i also connected it to the blynk and configured it like that from blynk i can give command which than transmit the signal which i decoded before.. and this works from anywhere in the world
